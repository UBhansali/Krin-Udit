2. A `README.md` file in this repository, which is the project plan
3. A 3-slide slide show to be presented in class

## Due Dates

## Written Proposal Instructions

Teams will submit ONE written proposal, with sections that each member has done individually detailing their proposed contributions. The submission will be the `README.md` file in your brand-new project repository, which you'll make. 

You must start using GitHub collaboratively from this point forward. 

Instructions: 

1. create a new repo as part of the `oplS16projects` organization; add your teammates to it
2. Copy the content from the [template file](template.md) into your `README.md`
3. Everyone on the team contributes their sections to your `README.md` file.
4. Send Fred/Mark the link to your new repository (exactly how TBD)

And now some detail on what to write _in_ the report.

**Overall guidance:** *You should be proposing something that you have high confidence that you can achieve, and the proposal should project that confidence.*

The proposal should be no longer than necessary, but long enough to include critical detail. Three pages is appropriate. Diagrams are welcome. 

Remember, you can do some neat [formatting things with Markdown.][markdown]

In case you missed it, here again is the [template file](template.md)

## In-Class Presentation Instructions
Teams will each deliver an in-class presentation.

Your team will have two minutes to present. Create presentation with two or three slides. Make the slides in google drive, and share the public-viewable link with Mark/Fred (exactly how TBD). The day of presentations, I'll have the list of links on the display computer, so each team can simply click their link and begin.
