***Students: this document is actively being revised. All dates and info are subject to change.***

Project Proposal is due Mon 2016-04-04

* Produce a plan for your final project, and prepare an in-class presentation.
* Start your real project repository

Ask questions, as always, [on our discussion forum!][forum]

## Written Proposal Instructions

Teams will submit ONE written proposal, with sections that each member has done individually detailing their proposed contributions. The submission will be the `README.md` file in your brand-new project repository, which you'll make. 

You must start using GitHub collaboratively from this point forward. 

Instructions: 

1. create a new repo as part of the `oplS16projects` organization; add your teammates to it
2. Copy the content from the [template file](template.md) into your `README.md`
3. Everyone on the team contributes their sections to your `README.md` file.
4. Send Fred/Mark the link to your new repository (exactly how TBD)

And now some detail on what to write _in_ the report.

**Overall guidance:** *You should be proposing something that you have high confidence that you can achieve, and the proposal should project that confidence.*

The proposal should be no longer than necessary, but long enough to include critical detail. Three pages is appropriate. Diagrams are welcome. 

Remember, you can do some neat [formatting things with Markdown.][markdown]

## In-Class Presentation Instructions
Teams will each deliver an in-class presentation. **Presentations will be Wednesday, April 8** (and Friday, April 10 as necessary). The presentation material is due on April 8 by 9 am for everybody. [See piazza for full schedule.][piazza]

Your team will have two minutes to present. Create presentation with two or three slides. Make the slides in google drive, and share the public-viewable link at the bottom of this report. The day of presentations, I'll have the list of links on the display computer, so each team can simply click their link and begin. 


## Proposal Presentations
Create your 2- to 3-slide presentation in [Google Slides][gslides]. Then, import them into one of the two slide decks:

* [Martin section][martinslides]
* [Sherman section][shermanslides]
